# sphericalRobot

Code for tracking a spherical robot using an IMU and vision system.

The "Filter" files is the IMU code, make sure to download the file and have all those files in the same directory when running the code.

Tracking.py is the software for the vision system. Change the upper and lower bounds of the mask to decide on the color that is going to be tracked.
